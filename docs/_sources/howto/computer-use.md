# How to Automate GUIs with Computer Use

Use gptme to control desktop applications, automate web forms, and capture screenshots
with the computer and browser tools.

## Prerequisites

Install the required system tools before using computer control:

```bash
# Check what's missing and see fix suggestions
gptme-doctor

# Linux/X11
sudo apt install xdotool scrot
# or: sudo pacman -S xdotool scrot

# macOS
brew install cliclick
# Then grant your terminal Screen Recording + Accessibility permissions in System Settings (macOS Ventura+) or System Preferences (older macOS)
```

For web automation (structured ARIA snapshots), install Playwright:

```bash
# Install gptme with browser support (provides the 'playwright' CLI)
pip install "gptme[browser]"
# Install Playwright system browsers (required for snapshot_url, open_page, etc.)
playwright install chromium
```

Optional: for screen recording (``start_recording`` / ``record_screen``), install ffmpeg:

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# or: sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

Optional: for accessibility-first control of native Linux apps (no screenshot needed),
install the AT-SPI2 stack:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyatspi
# or: sudo pacman -S python-pyatspi
```

For headless Linux environments, start an Xvfb display first:

```bash
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
export DISPLAY=:1
fluxbox &   # or any window manager
```

## Start a computer-use session

The `computer-use` profile sets the right tool access and backend selection policy:

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use 'take a screenshot and describe what you see'
```

Or enable the computer tool for a one-off task:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer 'open Firefox, navigate to github.com, and take a screenshot'
```

## Web automation (structured-first)

For web targets, prefer structured ARIA snapshots over raw screenshots — they're faster,
cheaper, and more reliable when the page has a DOM you can address:

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use 'go to https://news.ycombinator.com, find the top story, and summarize it'
```

gptme will automatically:
1. Use `snapshot_url()` to read the page's ARIA/accessibility tree
2. Use `open_page()` + `click_element()` / `fill_element()` when it needs to interact
3. Fall back to screenshots only for canvas, layout verification, or image-heavy content

Use `observe_web(url)` as a single-call shortcut — it calls `snapshot_url()` internally
and optionally appends a screenshot in one call:

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use 'use observe_web() to read https://news.ycombinator.com and summarize the top story'
```

Fill a form without screenshots:

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use \
  'go to the login form at http://localhost:3000/login, fill username "alice" and password "hunter2", click submit'
```

## Authenticated sessions (save and reuse login state)

For sites that require a login — Twitter/X, GitHub, your app — log in once and
save the session so future runs start already authenticated.

**Step 1: Log in and save the session**

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use \
  'open https://x.com/login, fill username and password, click Log in, then call save_browser_state("~/.config/gptme/twitter-session.json")'
```

Or interactively from IPython inside a gptme session:

```python
open_page("https://x.com/login")
fill_element("#username", "yourhandle")
click_element("text=Next")
fill_element("[name='password']", "yourpassword")
click_element("text=Log in")
save_browser_state("~/.config/gptme/twitter-session.json")
```

**Step 2: Load the session in future runs**

```bash
export GPTME_BROWSER_STORAGE_STATE=~/.config/gptme/twitter-session.json
gptme --agent-profile computer-use 'go to https://x.com/compose/tweet, type "Hello from gptme!", and click Post'
```

Every `open_page()`, `snapshot_url()`, and `read_url()` call will now start with
the saved cookies and localStorage, so the site sees you as already logged in.

> **Security note**: The session file contains your browser cookies in plain
> text. Store it with restricted permissions (`chmod 600`) and keep it out of
> version control.

## Desktop / native app control

For native apps or anything not reachable via a URL, the `computer` tool takes over:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer 'open the calculator app, compute 137 * 42, and tell me the result'
```

### Accessibility-first (Linux AT-SPI2 / macOS)

On Linux (with `python3-pyatspi` installed) and macOS, prefer accessibility-first
interaction over pixel coordinates — it's robust against window position and size changes:

```bash
# Inspect the native accessibility tree of all open apps (no screenshot needed)
gptme --tools +computer 'use computer("accessibility_tree") to list the interactive elements in the open dialog'

# Click an element by role and name — no coordinates needed
gptme --tools +computer 'click the Save button using click_accessible_element'
```

In IPython inside a gptme session:

```python
# Linux: role names like "push button", "entry", "check box"
computer('accessibility_tree')
computer('click_accessible_element', text='push button:Save')

# macOS: role names use AX prefix
computer('accessibility_tree')
computer('click_accessible_element', text='AXButton:Save')
```

Fall back to coordinate-based `left_click` only for apps without accessibility support
(games, canvas UIs, some Electron apps).

The observe-act-verify loop:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer \
  'take a screenshot to see the current state' \
  - 'click the "New File" button at the top-left' \
  - 'type "hello world" then press Control+S' \
  - 'take a screenshot and confirm the file was saved'
```

## Screenshot and visual verification

Use `observe_desktop()` as a single-call shortcut for taking a desktop screenshot with
explicit observation intent — equivalent to `computer('screenshot')` but signals the
"look" phase of a look-act-look loop:

```python
# From IPython inside a gptme session
msg = observe_desktop()   # returns a screenshot message, or None if capture failed
```

Take a screenshot and analyse what's on screen:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer,+vision 'screenshot the screen and describe any UI errors you see'
```

Verify a web page renders correctly:

```bash
gptme --agent-profile computer-use \
  'open http://localhost:5173, take a screenshot, and check that the login button is visible'
```

## Efficient UI loops

Use `act_and_observe(action, ...)` to perform an action and automatically get a screenshot
once the screen settles — one call instead of separate action + wait + screenshot:

```python
# From IPython inside a gptme session
msgs = act_and_observe("left_click", coordinate=(760, 540))   # click then observe
msgs = act_and_observe("window_focus", text="Terminal")        # focus then observe
msgs = act_and_observe("type", text="ls -la\n")               # type then observe
```

Use `wait_for_change` after triggering actions when you need a longer timeout or more
control than `act_and_observe`'s 3-second default:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer \
  'click the submit button, then wait for the screen to change and describe the result'
```

Use `window_focus` when opening new windows so input goes to the right app:

```bash
gptme --tools +computer \
  'open a new terminal window, wait for it to appear, then run "ls -la"'
```

## Context-efficient multi-step tasks

For long, multi-step automations — filling multi-page forms, running GUI workflows, or
anything that would generate dozens of screenshots — use `computer_task()` to delegate
the whole task to a subagent. All intermediate screenshots stay inside the subagent's
context; only a text summary comes back to the parent:

```python
# From IPython inside a gptme session with the computer tool enabled
result = computer_task(
    "Open Firefox, go to https://x.com/compose/tweet, "
    "type 'Hello from gptme!', and click Tweet.",
    timeout=120,
)
print(result["status"], result["result"])
```

This is the "context-efficient tool-use loop until goal is achieved" pattern: rather
than having the parent accumulate dozens of screenshots and intermediate steps, the
subagent runs the full loop internally and reports back a brief summary.

If the task fails or you need the full step-by-step transcript:

```python
from gptme.tools.subagent import subagent_read_log
print(subagent_read_log(result["agent_id"]))
```

## Record a session (create demo videos)

Use `gptme-util computer record` to capture a screen recording as an MP4, then
`video-frames` to extract key frames for review or as visual context in gptme:

```bash
# Record 30 seconds to a file (blocks until done, then prints the path)
gptme-util computer record /tmp/tweet-demo.mp4 --duration 30

# Record at higher fps for smoother game-like recordings
gptme-util computer record game.mp4 --fps 24 --duration 10

# Extract frames for LLM review
gptme-util computer video-frames /tmp/tweet-demo.mp4 --fps 1 --limit 10
```

From IPython inside a gptme session, use `start_recording()` for async control:

```python
# Start recording, interact, then stop
rec = start_recording("demo.mp4")
computer_task("open Firefox, go to https://example.com, and describe the page")
path = rec.stop()     # saves the MP4
print(f"Saved to {path}")

# Or as a context manager:
with start_recording("demo.mp4") as rec:
    computer_task("open Firefox, navigate to https://x.com/compose/tweet, "
                  "type 'Hello from gptme!', and click Tweet.", timeout=120)
print(rec.output_path)

# Fixed-duration, synchronous:
path = record_screen("demo.mp4", duration=30)
```

Recordings use H.264 with fast-start so they play directly in any browser.
Combine with `video-frames` to extract a small set of key frames for debugging
or including as visual evidence in GitHub issues.

## Run inside Docker (isolated headless desktop)

For a fully isolated environment with VNC access:

```bash
make build-docker-computer   # build once
make run-docker-computer     # start container (noVNC on :6080, gptme server on :8080)
```

Then connect a browser to `http://localhost:6080` to watch the agent work.
Use `gptme-util computer record` inside the container to capture what the agent does.

## Backend selection cheat sheet

| Situation | Tool to use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Read a web page (no screenshot) | `observe_web(url)` or `snapshot_url(url)` |
| Fill a form or click a link | `open_page(url)` + `click_element()` / `fill_element()` |
| Observe current desktop state | `observe_desktop()` |
| Visual layout check / canvas | `computer('screenshot')` |
| Inspect native app elements (Linux/macOS) | `computer('accessibility_tree')` |
| Click native element by role + name | `computer('click_accessible_element', text='push button:Save')` |
| Wait for UI to settle | `computer('wait_for_change')` |
| Act then observe in one call | `act_and_observe(action, ...)` |
| Click a native app by coordinate | `computer('left_click', coordinate=(x, y))` |
| Type text in native app | `computer('type', text='...')` |
| Focus a window by name | `computer('window_focus', text='pattern')` |
| Scroll in native UI | `computer('scroll', coordinate=(x,y), text='down')` |
| Multi-step task, keep parent context lean | `computer_task(task, timeout=N)` |
| Record session for demo / debugging | `start_recording(path)` / `record_screen(path, duration=N)` |

## Tips

- **Use the `computer-use` profile**: it sets the backend selection policy so the agent
  picks the right tool automatically without extra prompting.
- **Prefer `observe_web(url)` for web**: it captures a structured ARIA snapshot in one
  call; use `snapshot_url` directly when you need lower-level control.
- **Combine with `--non-interactive`**: add `-n` for scripted or CI use where you don't want
  prompts (but ensure the task is well-scoped first).
- **Describe visual outcomes**: "confirm the dialog closed" works better than "click OK and move on".
