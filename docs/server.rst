Server
======

gptme provides multiple web-based interfaces for browser-based interactions, from lightweight options to sophisticated desktop-integrated experiences.

Installation
------------

To use gptme's server capabilities, install with server extras:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx install 'gptme[server]'

Start the server:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-server


For more CLI options, see the :ref:`CLI reference <cli:gptme-server>`.

gptme-webui: Modern Web Interface
---------------------------------

The primary web interface is `gptme-webui <https://github.com/gptme/gptme/tree/master/webui>`_: a modern, feature-rich application that provides a complete gptme experience in your browser. (Originally a `standalone repo <https://github.com/gptme/gptme-webui>`_, now merged into the main gptme repository.)

**Try it now:**

- `chat.gptme.org <https://chat.gptme.org>`_ (latest version of gptme-webui, bring your own gptme-server)
- `gptme.ai <https://gptme.ai>`_ (upcoming hosted gptme service)

**Key Features:**

- Modern interface
- Streaming responses
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Conversation export and offline capabilities
- Integrated computer use interface
- Create your own persistent `agents`

**Local Installation:**
For self-hosting and local development, see the `gptme-webui README <https://github.com/gptme/gptme/tree/master/webui>`_.

To use the server with a locally hosted gptme-webui, configure the CORS origin when starting the server:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-server --cors-origin 'http://localhost:5701'

.. note::

    **Connecting the hosted web UI to a local server (Chrome 142+).**
    When you use the hosted web UI at `chat.gptme.org <https://chat.gptme.org>`_
    with a ``gptme-server`` running on ``localhost``, recent Chromium browsers
    (Chrome 142+) gate the connection behind a *Local Network Access* permission
    prompt. This check runs *before* CORS headers are evaluated, so the
    ``--cors-origin`` flag is necessary but no longer sufficient — you must also
    click **Allow** on the permission prompt for the page to reach your local
    server. Serving the web UI from a local origin (for example
    ``http://localhost:5701``) avoids the prompt entirely, since that is a
    local-to-local request.

Self-Hosting with Docker Compose
--------------------------------

For a self-contained deployment, a ``docker-compose.yml`` is included at the
repository root. It builds a lean image (``scripts/Dockerfile.selfhost``,
gptme + the ``server`` extra only — no Node/agent tooling) and runs
``gptme-server`` with persistent volumes for config and conversation logs.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/gptme/gptme.git
   cd gptme

   # Configure: at least one provider key is required
   cp .env.example .env
   $EDITOR .env

   # Build and start the server
   docker compose up --build

The server listens on http://localhost:5700.

The simplest way to use it is the basic web UI the server bundles at the same
origin — just open http://localhost:5700 in a browser. Being same-origin, it
needs no CORS setup (you will still need the server token; see below).

To use the full-featured hosted web UI instead, open
`chat.gptme.org <https://chat.gptme.org>`_ and point it at your server. That is
a cross-origin setup, so the server must allow the UI's origin — the default
``CORS_ORIGIN`` already permits ``chat.gptme.org``. Set ``CORS_ORIGIN`` in
``.env`` to a different origin if you self-host the web UI yourself.

Key ``.env`` settings:

- ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` / ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` — at least one is required.
- ``GPTME_SERVER_TOKEN`` — auth token. The server enables auth by default when bound to ``0.0.0.0`` (as in the container), so set this and configure the web UI with the same value. If left blank, a token is auto-generated at startup — find it with ``docker compose logs``.
- ``CORS_ORIGIN`` — origin allowed to call the server (defaults to the hosted web UI).
- ``GPTME_SERVER_PORT`` — host port to publish (the container always listens on 5700).

Basic Web UI
------------

A lightweight chat interface with minimal dependencies is bundled with the gptme server for simple deployments.

Access at http://localhost:5700 after starting ``gptme-server``.

This interface provides basic chat functionality and is useful for:

- Quick testing and development
- Minimal server deployments
- Environments with limited resources

Computer Use Interface
----------------------

The computer use interface provides an innovative split-view experience with chat on the left and a live desktop environment on the right, enabling AI agents to interact directly with desktop applications.

.. include:: computer-use-warning.rst

**Docker Setup** (Recommended):

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/gptme/gptme.git
   cd gptme

   # Build and run the computer use container
   make build-docker-computer
   docker run -v ~/.config/gptme:/home/computeruse/.config/gptme -p 6080:6080 -p 8080:8080 gptme-computer:latest

**Access Points:**

- **Combined interface:** http://localhost:8080/computer
- **Chat only:** http://localhost:8080
- **Desktop only:** http://localhost:6080/vnc.html

**Features:**

- Split-view interface with real-time desktop interaction
- Toggle between view-only and interactive desktop modes
- Automatic screen scaling optimized for LLM vision models
- Secure containerized environment

**Requirements:**

- Docker with X11 support
- Available ports: 6080 (VNC) and 8080 (web interface)

Local Computer Use (Advanced)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable the ``computer`` tool locally on Linux systems, though this is not recommended for security reasons.

**Requirements:**

- X11 server
- ``xdotool`` package installed

**Usage:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Enable computer tool in addition to default tools
   gptme --tools +computer

Set an appropriate screen resolution for your vision model before use.

For long-running visual workflows, prefer a specialized subagent profile to keep
parent context smaller:

.. code-block:: python

   # Desktop interaction (mouse, keyboard, screenshots)
   subagent(
       "computer-use",
       "Click the Submit button, wait for the modal, and screenshot the result",
   )

   # Web browsing and testing
   subagent(
       "browser-use",
       "Open localhost:5173, capture a screenshot, and report UI issues",
   )

REST API
--------

gptme-server provides a REST API for programmatic access to gptme functionality. This enables integration with custom applications and automation workflows.

The API endpoints support the core gptme operations including chat interactions, tool execution, and conversation management.

.. note::
   API documentation is available when running the server. Visit the server endpoint ``/api/docs/`` for interactive API documentation based on the OpenAPI spec (served at ``/api/docs/openapi.json``).
