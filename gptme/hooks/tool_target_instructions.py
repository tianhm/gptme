"""
Inject AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md files when tools touch new directories.

Extends `agents_md_inject` from cwd-aware to tool-target-aware: when a structured
file tool (read, save, append, patch, etc.) references a path outside the
already-loaded directory tree, this hook discovers local agent instruction files
near that path and injects them before the next reasoning step.

Reuses the existing agent-file discovery (`find_agent_files_in_tree`) and the
`_loaded_agent_files_var` dedup set populated by `prompt_workspace()` and
`agents_md_inject`. Identical-content files (worktree copies) are skipped via
content-hash dedup.

Phase 1: structured file tools only (read/save/append/patch/morph). Shell command
parsing is intentionally out of scope — `cwd.changed` covers that.

See: knowledge/technical-designs/tool-targeted-agent-instruction-loading.md
