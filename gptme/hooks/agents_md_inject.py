"""
Inject AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md files when the working directory changes.

When the user `cd`s to a new directory during a session, this hook checks if there
are any agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) that haven't been
loaded yet. If found, their contents are injected as system messages.

This extends the tree-walking AGENTS.md loading from prompt_workspace() (which runs
at startup) to also work mid-session when the CWD changes.

The set of already-loaded files is shared with prompt_workspace() via the
_loaded_agent_files_var ContextVar defined in prompts.py, which seeds it at startup.

Subscribes to the centralized CWD_CHANGED hook type instead of independently
tracking pre/post CWD values.

In server mode (Flask), ContextVars don't propagate across HTTP request contexts, so
_loaded_agent_files_var starts as None on each request. To avoid re-injecting
already-loaded files, _get_loaded_files() falls back to scanning the conversation log
for <agent-instructions> system messages when the ContextVar is empty.

Agent-identity guard: instruction files inside a *different gptme agent workspace*
(a directory whose ``gptme.toml`` declares an ``[agent]`` name other than the
current session's agent) are never injected. In a multi-agent setup each agent's
workspace ``AGENTS.md`` typically defines that agent's identity, git identity and
operational rules, so loading it because of a ``cd`` would silently hand the
session another agent's persona. A short visible notice is emitted instead, once
per foreign workspace. Instruction files elsewhere (other projects, subdirectories
of the current workspace) still load as before, and each load is announced with a
short visible message naming the file.
