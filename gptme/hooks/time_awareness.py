"""
Time awareness hook.

Provides time feedback during conversations to help the assistant manage
long-running sessions effectively.

This helps the assistant:
- Understand conversation duration
- Plan work within time constraints
- Manage long-running autonomous sessions effectively
- Avoid timeouts and performance issues

Shows time elapsed messages at: 1min, 5min, 10min, 15min, 20min, then every 10min.

All times come from a single clock (:func:`gptme.util.clock.now`): the wall clock as a
timezone-aware datetime in the system's local timezone. Notices always include
the full date and UTC offset, so they stay unambiguous across date boundaries.
Elapsed time is measured from the real session start (the earliest message in
the log, which survives resume), and gaps in the conversation (e.g. a resume after
hours of inactivity) are reported explicitly instead of silently jumping.
