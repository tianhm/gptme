"""Progress tool — subagents use this to send intermediate updates to the parent.

Registers the ``progress`` block type so subagents can report status mid-task
without stopping their session. The parent orchestrator receives these updates
via the LOOP_CONTINUE hook as ⏳ system messages, enabling the "fire-and-forget-
then-get-alerted-when-update/done" pattern alongside ``complete`` and ``clarify``.

Unlike ``complete`` (ends session) and ``clarify`` (pauses session), ``progress``
continues execution after delivering the update.

Only works in thread-mode subagents (same process). Subprocess-mode subagents
cannot share the in-process progress queue, so updates are not delivered when
the agent_id cannot be resolved.

Only enabled in autonomous/subagent sessions (disabled_by_default=True).

Use this block to send an intermediate status update to the parent orchestrator
while your task is still in progress. The session continues after the update.

```progress
Brief status: what you have completed so far and what still remains.
```

Guidelines:
- Use for meaningful milestones, not every step (too many updates are noise)
- Keep it brief — one or two sentences summarizing state and next steps
- Use ``complete`` when fully done, ``clarify`` when blocked on a question

Example milestones worth reporting:
- Finished analysis phase, starting implementation
- Encountered an obstacle, switching approach
- Completed subtask A, now working on B
