    """Starts an asynchronous subagent. Returns None immediately.

    Subagent completions are delivered via the LOOP_CONTINUE hook, enabling
    a "fire-and-forget-then-get-alerted" pattern where the orchestrator can
    continue working and get notified when subagents finish.

    Profile auto-detection: If ``agent_id`` matches a known profile name
    (e.g. "explorer", "researcher", "developer", "verifier") or a common role alias
    ("explore"→"explorer", "research"→"researcher", "impl"/"dev"→"developer", "verify"→"verifier"),
    the profile is applied automatically — no need to pass ``profile`` separately.

    Role-based defaults (``role`` parameter):

    - ``"explore"``: Defaults profile to ``explorer`` (read-only analysis)
    - ``"implement"``: Defaults profile to ``developer`` (full capability)
    - ``"verify"``: Defaults profile to ``verifier`` plus ``use_subprocess=True`` and ``isolated=True`` (read-only validation in isolation)

    Explicit arguments override role defaults.

    Args:
        agent_id: Unique identifier for the subagent. If it matches a known
            profile name (or a common alias like ``impl``/``dev``), that
            profile is auto-applied (unless ``profile`` is explicitly set
            to something else).
        prompt: Task prompt for the subagent (used as context for planner mode)
        mode: "executor" for single task, "planner" for delegating to multiple executors
        subtasks: List of subtask definitions for planner mode (required when mode="planner")
        execution_mode: "parallel" (default) runs all subtasks concurrently,
                       "sequential" runs subtasks one after another.
                       Only applies to planner mode.
        context_mode: Controls what context is shared with the subagent:
            - "full" (default): Share complete context (agent identity, tools, workspace)
            - "selective": Share only specified context components (requires context_include)
        context_include: For selective mode, list of context components to include:
            - Thread mode supports "agent" and "tools"
            - Subprocess mode also supports "workspace", which maps to the CLI's "files" context
            Legacy subprocess values like "files", "cmd", and "all" are still accepted.
        use_subprocess: If True, run subagent in subprocess for output isolation.
            Subprocess mode captures stdout/stderr separately from the parent.
        use_acp: If True, run subagent via ACP (Agent Client Protocol).
            This enables multi-harness support — the subagent can be any
            ACP-compatible agent (gptme, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).
            Requires the ``acp`` package: pip install 'gptme[acp]'.
        acp_command: ACP agent command to invoke (default: "gptme-acp").
            Only used when use_acp=True. Can be any ACP-compatible CLI.
        profile: Agent profile name to apply. Profiles provide:
            - System prompt customization (behavioral hints)
            - Tool access restrictions (which tools the subagent can use)
            - Behavior rules (read-only, no-network, etc.)
            Use 'gptme-util profile list' to see available profiles.
            Built-in profiles: default, explorer, researcher, developer, verifier, isolated, computer-use, browser-use.
            If not set, auto-detected from agent_id when it matches a profile name.
        model: Model to use for the subagent. Overrides parent's model.
            Useful for routing cheap tasks to faster/cheaper models.
        isolated: If True, run the subagent in a git worktree for filesystem
            isolation. The subagent gets its own copy of the repository and
            can modify files without affecting the parent. The worktree is
            automatically cleaned up after the subagent completes.
            Falls back to a temporary directory if not in a git repo.
            Prefer ``isolation="worktree"`` for new code — it is the string-based
            API equivalent and enables smarter cleanup behaviour.
        isolation: String-based isolation mode. Use ``"worktree"`` to create a
            temporary git worktree for the subagent, giving it an isolated copy
            of the repository to work in. On completion:

            - **No local changes**: worktree directory *and* branch are removed
              automatically (zero cleanup needed).
            - **Local changes exist**: the branch is preserved and its name is
              reported in the result so the orchestrator can inspect or merge it.
              The working-tree directory is still removed.

            Falls back to a temporary directory when not in a git repository.
            Equivalent to ``isolated=True`` but adds smart cleanup behaviour.
        timeout: Maximum seconds before the subprocess monitor kills the
            subagent (default 1800 = 30 min). Only applies to subprocess mode.
        redact_secrets: If True (default), scrub common secret patterns from
            workspace context messages before they are passed to the subagent.
            Redacts values from lines where the variable name matches patterns
            like API_KEY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, PRIVATE_KEY, etc.

            Note: subagents do NOT inherit the parent's conversation history —
            they always start with a fresh context containing only the task
            prompt and workspace context (files from gptme.toml [prompt] files,
            and context_cmd output when context_mode="full"). This option
            sanitizes that inherited workspace context.

            Only applies to thread-mode subagents (subprocess and ACP modes
            run as a separate gptme process and handle their own context).
            Set to False to disable redaction if legitimate config values are
            being incorrectly redacted.
        context_window: Limit workspace context messages passed to the subagent.
            Controls how much of the workspace context (files from gptme.toml
            [prompt] files, context_cmd output) is shared with the subagent.

            - ``None`` (default): no limit — full workspace context is shared.
            - ``0``: minimal context — only agent identity and tools; no workspace
              files or context_cmd output. Equivalent to
              ``context_mode="selective", context_include=["agent", "tools"]``.
            - ``N > 0``: at most N workspace context messages are passed.

            Use ``context_window=0`` when the subagent does not need the parent
            workspace configuration (e.g. a verification task that should only
            see what the orchestrator explicitly tells it).

            Only applies to thread-mode subagents; has no effect in subprocess
            or ACP modes (which build their own context as a separate process).
        max_time: Wall-clock time limit in seconds. When set, a watchdog timer
            marks the subagent result as ``"timeout"`` after ``max_time`` seconds
            and delivers a timeout status notification via the LOOP_CONTINUE hook.
            In subprocess mode the child process is terminated. In thread mode
            the background thread is not force-stopped; callers see the cached
            timeout result immediately while the thread continues until it
            finishes naturally. Defaults to ``None`` (no limit).

            Use this for defensive orchestration (prevent a stuck subagent from
            blocking the parent) or hard time budgets in autonomous sessions.
            ``max_time=None`` is fully backwards-compatible — no change in behavior.
        context_turns: Number of recent parent conversation turns to forward to
            the subagent as context. A "turn" starts at a user message and
            includes all subsequent assistant and tool-result (system) messages
            until the next user message, so the total message count per turn
            varies with the number of tool calls. The messages are injected as
            a system message so the subagent understands what the parent has
            been doing without confusing its own conversation flow.

            - ``None`` (default): no parent context forwarded (current behavior).
            - ``N > 0``: forward the last N turns from the parent's active log.

            The parent log is fetched automatically from the currently active
            ``LogManager`` (set by the chat loop via ``ContextVar``). This works
            when ``subagent()`` is called from within the ``ipython`` tool during
            a running chat session.

            Use this when the subagent needs awareness of what the parent has
            already done (e.g. "the parent tried A and B, now try C") or when
            the task prompt alone doesn't provide enough context.

            Only applies to thread-mode subagents; has no effect in subprocess
            or ACP modes.
        workdir: Working directory for the subagent. Defaults to the current
            working directory (``Path.cwd()``) when ``None``.

            Use this when you want the subagent to operate in a specific
            directory — for example, when a ``cd`` into a project with a
            ``gptme.toml`` triggers workspace detection and you want the
            subagent to load that workspace's config:

            .. code-block:: python

                subagent("impl", "Add feature X", workdir="/path/to/project",
                         use_subprocess=True)

            In subprocess mode the subagent process starts with this as its
            ``cwd``, so it picks up the ``gptme.toml`` from that directory.
            In thread mode the workspace context (files, ``context_cmd``) is
            loaded relative to this path.

    Returns:
        None: Starts asynchronous execution.
            In executor mode, starts a single task execution.
            In planner mode, starts execution of all subtasks using the specified execution_mode.

            Executors use the `complete` tool to signal completion with a summary.
            The full conversation log is available at the logdir path.

    messages at each step boundary so the very next LLM call in the same
    agentic turn sees the guidance immediately — no need to wait for the
    current tool chain to finish.  Works for thread-mode and subprocess-mode
    subagents.

    This is distinct from ``subagent_reply()``, which re-spawns a subagent that
    has *already stopped* with a ``clarification_needed`` status. Use this
    function to steer a subagent that is still actively running.

    Args:
        agent_id: The running subagent to steer.
        message: The guidance to inject. This will appear as a user turn in the
            subagent's conversation on its next loop iteration.

    Returns:
        A human-readable confirmation message.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no subagent with ``agent_id`` is found, or if the
            subagent has already finished (use ``subagent_reply()`` for
            clarification-needed subagents).
        NotImplementedError: If the subagent is running in ACP mode, which
            does not expose a logdir channel for steering.

    Note:
        Delivery is **guaranteed for both thread-mode and subprocess-mode**
        subagents:

        - **Thread mode**: ``prompt_queue_closed`` is a Python event set inside
          the subagent thread immediately when ``chat()`` returns.
        - **Subprocess mode**: ``chat()`` writes a ``"prompt-queue-closed"``
          sentinel file to the logdir in its ``finally`` block — before the
          process exits — giving a child-side signal that closes the drain
          boundary precisely.  The parent-side ``prompt_queue_closed`` event
          (set after ``_monitor_subprocess`` returns) is a second-level catch.

        Any steer attempted after the sentinel/event is set raises
        ``ValueError``.

    Example::

        subagent("researcher", "Research Python async frameworks")
        # ... the researcher is going off-track ...
        subagent_steer("researcher", "Focus only on frameworks with >5k GitHub stars")

        in ``_run_chat_loop`` (non-interactive exit) and right before raising
        ``SessionCompleteException`` — and again in ``chat()``'s ``finally``
        block as a safety net.  Checking this file for both thread and
        subprocess mode closes the race window between ``chat()``'s last
        drain and ``prompt_queue_closed.set()`` being called.

        Thread mode: the sentinel file is the primary, early signal.
        ``prompt_queue_closed`` is a Python event set immediately *after*
        ``chat()`` returns — slightly later than the file, so it is a
        second-level catch.

        Subprocess mode: the sentinel file is written by the child inside
        ``chat()``, before the process exits.  ``prompt_queue_closed`` is
        set by the parent launcher after the process exits — a second-level
        catch here too.
