"""Content scoring and extractive compression for auto-compacting.

Provides heuristic-based sentence scoring and extractive summarization
for compressing long messages while preserving high-value content.

Also provides relevance scoring for tool outputs (Phase 0 pre-pass):
score_tool_output_relevance() assigns each tool result a keep/drop score
based on age, error content, and whether any of its paths/commands appear
in later messages.  A low score + large size → eligible for pre-pass drop
before the Phase 2 truncation even fires.

PruneDecision is the per-message record emitted by the shadow/dry-run pass
(shadow_prune_stale_tool_outputs) so callers can analyse what Phase 0 would
have done without actually modifying the log.

    Fields
    ------
    idx:
        Position in the original log.
    decision:
        ``"keep"`` — message would be left unchanged.
        ``"drop"`` — message would be replaced by a short stub.
    score:
        Relevance score returned by :func:`score_tool_output_relevance`.
        ``None`` when the message was not eligible (too recent, non-tool, etc.)
        and is always kept without scoring.
    tokens:
        Original token count of the message.
    stub_tokens:
        Token count of the replacement stub (only meaningful when
        ``decision == "drop"``; 0 for kept messages).
    tokens_saved:
        ``tokens - stub_tokens`` when dropped, else 0.
    content_digest:
        First 8 hex characters of the SHA-256 of *normalized* original
        content (see :func:`normalize_for_digest`). Compare against later
        tool outputs after the same normalization to measure false-drop
        rate. A later ``read`` of the same payload matches even though the
        raw message includes a path label, cat -n line numbers, and code
        fences. Unnumbered output is left intact, so ``42 value`` does not
        collide with ``value``. Shell-formatted output (prompts, pytest,
