"""Content scoring and extractive compression for auto-compacting.

Provides heuristic-based sentence scoring and extractive summarization
for compressing long messages while preserving high-value content.

Also provides relevance scoring for tool outputs (Phase 0 pre-pass):
score_tool_output_relevance() assigns each tool result a keep/drop score
based on age, error content, and whether any of its paths/commands appear
in later messages.  A low score + large size → eligible for pre-pass drop
before the Phase 2 truncation even fires.
