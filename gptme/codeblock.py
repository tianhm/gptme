    The quote-state parameters let callers carry per-character quote state
    across lines so that a multiline single-quoted string (e.g.
    ``s='\\n<< EOF\\n'``) is not misidentified as a heredoc opener on the
    continuation line.  Returns the end-of-line quote state so callers can
    pass it into the next invocation.

    ``in_ansi_c`` tracks bash ANSI-C quoting (``$'...'``), where backslash
    escapes *are* processed (unlike POSIX single quotes).  Without this,
    ``x=$'a\\'b'`` is scanned as POSIX ``'...'`` and leaves ``in_single``
    set, so a later closing fence is treated as quoted content.

    Only recognizes ``<<`` operators at top-level (outside quoted strings,
    outside comments, and not backslash-escaped): a heredoc operator is
    shell syntax and never occurs inside a quoted literal or a ``#``
    comment, so ``echo "a << b"`` and ``# see a << b`` are correctly
    ignored while ``cat << 'EOF' > file.md`` is recognized. A backslash
    escapes the next character (matching shell quoting rules), so
    ``echo \\# not-a-comment`` and escaped quotes inside a double-quoted
    string don't desync the quote tracker. The terminator word accepts any
    run of non-whitespace, non-quote, non-backslash characters (bash
    heredoc words aren't restricted to ``\\w``, e.g. ``<<'END-TAG'``), with
    an optional single leading quote-or-backslash consumed but not part of
    the terminator (``<<'EOF'``, ``<<"EOF"``, and ``<<\\EOF`` all use the
    plain word ``EOF``). A ``<<<`` here-string takes one inline value and
    never opens a multi-line body, so it's explicitly not matched here -
    otherwise the capture group would swallow the third ``<`` as part of
    the (bogus) terminator and heredoc state would never close. A ``<<``
    inside ``$((...))`` arithmetic expansion is always a bit-shift, and a
    ``<<`` whose right operand is a bare integer literal is too, so both
    are rejected to avoid minting a phantom terminator that could swallow
    later fences.
