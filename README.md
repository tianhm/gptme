# gptme-webui

[![CI](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-webui/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gptme/gptme-webui/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A fancy web UI for [gptme][gptme], built with [gptengineer.app][gptengineer.app].

An alternative to the minimal UI currently provided by `gptme`.


## Features

 - Chat with LLMs using gptme, just like in the CLI, but with a fancy UI
 - Generate responses and run tools by connecting to your local gptme-server instance
 - Read bundled conversations without running gptme locally (useful for sharing)

## Usage

You can use the web UI hosted at [chat.gptme.org](https://chat.gptme.org/), or run it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gptme/gptme-webui
cd gptme-webui
npm i
npm run dev
```

To connect to a local `gptme-server` instance, you need to start one with `gptme-server --cors-origin='https://chat.gptme.org'` (or whatever the origin of your web UI is).
