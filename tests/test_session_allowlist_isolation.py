"""Regression test: the web-tool host allowlist must not leak across tests.

``set_session_allow_hosts`` writes a module-level ``ContextVar`` that outlives
the test that set it on the same xdist worker. Left unreset, a test that
installs the empty allowlist (``[]`` — "block every host") leaks it into every
later test, so unrelated browser tests fail with ``Host 'example.com' is not in
the session's allowed-hosts list ()`` depending on run order. The autouse
``reset_session_allow_hosts`` fixture in ``conftest.py`` clears it around every
test; these tests assert the isolation holds.

The checks are deliberately self-contained in one process rather than split
across two tests that rely on running on the same xdist worker. CI runs
``pytest -n auto`` with the default ``--dist load`` scheduler, which does *not*
honour ``xdist_group``; two sibling tests can land on different workers, so a
"second test sees ``None``" assertion would pass vacuously (against a fresh
worker default) even if the reset fixture were removed. Instead we drive the
autouse fixture's own generator directly, so the guard fails if the fixture is
removed, loses its ``autouse=True``, or stops resetting.
